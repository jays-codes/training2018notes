	- modify and save in working area
	+ commit and push change
	+ update notes archive
	
+ update notes archives
	- goto notes archive
	- git pull

+ work on a bug or feature
	+ create branch for new feature or bugfix
	- work on branch
	+ commit and push
	+ merge to parent branch
	+ tag parent branch
	+ delete branch

+ resolveing a merge conflict
	- git mergetool
	- resolve conflict and save
	- git diff --cached <- compares cached version with repo ver 

+ temporarily save changes that you dont want to appear in your current branch
	+ stash

+ tagging a branch
	- git tag -s <tag>
	- git push --tags

+ commit and push change
	- git add
	- git commit
	- git push

+ add an alias
	- git config --global alias.<name> "<command> --<option1> --<optionN>"

-----------------------
Alias
+ lgoad -> log --graph --oneline --all --decorate

-----------------------
commands

+ git blame <filename> -> shows where lines in a file are coming from

+ git reset <sha1> --hard -> moves current branch to point at specific commit and copies to working area and index. forward commits will have no reference and be garbage collected
	--mixed -> copies to index
	--soft -> just move branch within commit in repo
	--hard HEAD -> reset working copy and index to whats in current commit in repo

+ git rm -f <file> -> remove file from working are and index
+ git rm --cached <file> -> remove from index

+ git mv <file1> <file2> -> rename files. moves from working area to index

+ git diff -> compares working area and index
+ git diff --cached compares index and repo
+ git diff <branch1> <branchN> compares 2 branches
+ git diff <sha1> <sha1> <-- compares commits

+ merge to parent branch (put changes in current branch to parent branch)
	- go to parent branch
	- git merge <branch where changes come from>
	- git push

+ stash
	- git stash
	- git stash pop <- applies latest stash
	- git stash apply

	-> like a clipboard

+ create branch
	- git branch <branch name>
	+ push to remote
	+ checkout branch

+ push branch to remote 
	- git push <remote> <branch>

+ checkout branch
	-> moves data from repo to working copy
	- git checkout <branch name>

+ delete branch
	+ force local delete -> git branch -D <branch>
	+ remote delete -> git push -d <remote> <branch>

+ get all references where head has pointed
	+ git reflog

+ points branch head to specific sha1 reference
	+ git reflog <- to get the specific sha1
	+ git branch <branch> <sha1>
	+ git checkout <branch>

+ show where HEAD is pointing
	- git show HEAD
+ git show <sha1> -> show info about commit

+ git cherry-pick <sha1> <- applies current head to commit pointer

+ list remote branches
	- git branch -r
